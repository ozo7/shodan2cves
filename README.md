# shodan2cves
python application to transform large shodan data and match it to large CVE data => find IoT devices that have publicly known vulnerabilities!

This is the implementation of my final Master thesis. You can find the document on www.olaf-schmidt.com . The paper is in German, but I am thinking about updating the script, translate my paper and offer a service on this. Feel free to contact me, I would like to get feedback!
